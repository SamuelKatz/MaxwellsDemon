Maxwell's Demon: A Game by Sam Katz

Figure out which of the three demons is keeping you trapped in this nether dimension.

Move around with the arrow keys. Moving into the room of one of the suspects will cause the clue for that suspect to display.

When you've decided which demon you think it is, select by pressing space in that demon's room.
If you're right you'll be sent up to a grassy field to walk around in.  If you're wrong you'll fall down into darkness.
Either way you can press enter to play again.  

Press Enter on the title screen to Begin. 
An inconsistent bug sometimes causes the title screen text to not display leaving a blank screen. If this happens, pressing enter still starts the game. 

Press ESC at any time to exit.
